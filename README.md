# Tasks list application (React)

This is a simple frontend React application that uses functional components, hooks (useState, useEffect) and routing (react-router-dom). Of course, it has some CSS styling as well, don't you worry. 

It has a mock backend server using [json-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server?activeTab=readme) for REST API calls.

## How to run it

1. In the project directory, start up the backend: `npm run server`

2. Then start up the app in development mode: `npm run start`
